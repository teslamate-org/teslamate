# TeslaMate Trademark Policy

Last updated: February 2, 2026

## 1. Purpose

This policy exists to protect the integrity of the **TeslaMate Software** and its community. It ensures that users can clearly distinguish between the official, open-source project and unofficial, commercial, or potentially deceptive third-party offerings.

It exists alongside the software’s [license](https://github.com/teslamate-org/teslamate/blob/main/LICENSE) (AGPLv3). The AGPLv3 covers the code; this policy covers the branding.

## 2. Protected Marks

The trademark includes the name **TeslaMate** (hereinafter referred to as "TeslaMate" or "brand"), the software (hereinafter referred to as "TeslaMate") and related visual identity elements (hereinafter referred to as "Logos"). The name must always be written in CamelCase: TeslaMate (never "Teslamate", "teslamate", "tesla mate", "Tesla-Mate", or any other variation).

## 3. Philosophy

TeslaMate is open source and encourages self-hosting.

We want individuals, communities, and non-profits to freely use the TeslaMate name and logo for non-commercial purposes.\
At the same time, we reserve the right to control commercial use of the brand.

## 4. Permitted Use (No Permission Required)

You may use the name "TeslaMate" and Logos without prior written permission for:

- Personal self-hosting — running TeslaMate for yourself, friends, or family.
- Compatibility Notices: Describing your own tool’s technical compatibility with the Software (e.g., "compatible with TeslaMate").
- Non-commercial Educational/Community Content: Using the name in blogs, tutorials, or forum discussions to talk about the project.
- Open Source Plugins: Free, open-source (AGPL-compatible) plugins may use the name in their description to indicate technical interoperability.
- Nominative references — talking about, writing about, or demonstrating TeslaMate truthfully.

## 5. Prohibited Use (Strictly Forbidden)

To prevent exploitation of the **Software** and its reputation, the following are strictly prohibited without prior written consent from the teslamate-org maintainers:

- Product Titles: You may not use "TeslaMate" as part of a product name, especially in combinations like "[Product] for TeslaMate", for any commercial or closed-source software, application, mobile application, or service.
- Misleading Affiliation: You may not use a name or branding that suggests an official endorsement, partnership, or that your product is a "Pro" or "Official" version of the Software.
- Using the TeslaMate name in a company name, brand, or product line.
- Marketing commercial support, consulting, or training under the TeslaMate name.
- Registering or using domains or social media handles containing "TeslaMate" that imply official status (e.g. teslamatecloud.com, @teslamateapp).
- Producing merchandise (shirts, stickers, etc.) with the TeslaMate name or Logos for sale.
- Deceptive Use: Using the name or logo to distribute malware, track users without consent, any illegal activities, or sell a "Pro" version of the official software.

## 6. Requirements for Third-Party Projects

Any unofficial tool that interfaces with TeslaMate in any way (this includes via API or database) must include a prominent disclaimer in its README and/or About section:

"This project is an unofficial community tool and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by the official TeslaMate project."

## 7. Enforcement

We reserve the right to file Trademark Infringement Complaints (e.g., App Store Takedowns or DMCA notices) against any individual or entity violating these rules.

## 8. Changes

This policy may be updated periodically. Any changes will be documented in this file.
