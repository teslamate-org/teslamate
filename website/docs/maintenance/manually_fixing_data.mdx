## Get the ID

First you need to find out the ID of the drive or charge:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
defaultValue="drive"
groupId="type"
values={[
    { label: 'Drive', value: 'drive', },
    { label: 'Charge', value: 'charge', },
]}>
<TabItem value="drive">

- Open the `Drives` dashboard and click on the start date of the drive.
- The URL will contain the drive ID, for example `&var-drive_id=9999`.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="charge">

- Open the `Charges` dashboard and click on the start date of the charge.
- The URL will contain the charge id, for example `&var-charging_process_id=9999`.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Terminate a drive or charge

If for some reason a drive or charge hasn't been fully recorded, for example due to a bug or an unexpected restart, you can terminate it manually. Among other things, this assigns an end date to the drive/charge.

Replace `9999` with the actual ID then run the command while the TeslaMate container is running:

<Tabs
defaultValue="drive"
groupId="type"
values={[
    { label: 'Drive', value: 'drive', },
    { label: 'Charge', value: 'charge', },
]}>
<TabItem value="drive">

```bash
docker compose exec teslamate bin/teslamate rpc \
    "TeslaMate.Repo.get!(TeslaMate.Log.Drive, 9999) |> TeslaMate.Log.close_drive()"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="charge">

```bash
docker compose exec teslamate bin/teslamate rpc \
    "TeslaMate.Repo.get!(TeslaMate.Log.ChargingProcess, 9999) |> TeslaMate.Log.complete_charging_process()"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Delete a drive or charge

If for some reason a drive or charge was recorded incorrectly, you can delete it.

1.  Attach to the **running** database container:

    ```bash
    docker compose exec database psql teslamate teslamate
    ```

    :::note
    If you get the error `No such service: database`, update your _docker-compose.yml_ or use `db` instead of `database` in the above command.
    :::

2.  Afterwards replace `9999` with the actual ID then run the query:

    <Tabs
    defaultValue="drive"
    groupId="type"
    values={[
        { label: 'Drive', value: 'drive', },
        { label: 'Charge', value: 'charge', },
    ]}>
    <TabItem value="drive">

    ```sql
    DELETE FROM drives WHERE id = 9999;
    ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="charge">

    ```sql
    DELETE FROM charging_processes WHERE id = 9999;
    ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

## Remove a vehicle from the database
**NOTE:** Always [backup](https://docs.teslamate.org/docs/maintenance/backup_restore "backup") your data before performing any database changes.

1. Connect to your TeslaMate database
2. Identify the right car ID in the database to remove
```
SELECT id, vin FROM cars;
```
3. Based upon the output, run the following command replacing `num` with the ID from the previous command. 
```
DELETE FROM cars WHERE id = num;
DELETE FROM car_settings WHERE id = num;
DELETE FROM charging_processes WHERE car_id = num;
DELETE from charges WHERE charging_process_id in (select id from charging_processes where car_id = num);
DELETE FROM drives WHERE car_id = num;
DELETE FROM positions WHERE car_id = num;
DELETE FROM states WHERE car_id = num;
DELETE FROM updates WHERE car_id = num;
```
