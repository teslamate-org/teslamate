title: Using the Tesla Fleet API and Telemetry Streaming (only for business fleet users)
---

## Official Tesla APIs

### Why Tesla Fleet and Telemetry only have drawbacks

As far as we know, using the Tesla Fleet API and Telemetry API as a user has only drawbacks. The only reason to use them is if you are a Tesla Business Fleet user and therefore the Owner API is no longer available for you.

### When Tesla Fleet API and Telemetry API are needed

By default, TeslaMate uses the "_unofficial_" Owner API and streaming.

Tesla now provides official APIs: the Fleet API and the Telemetry API, which replace the Owner API and streaming respectively. But come with limitations and drawbacks.

**Migration to the new API depends on your Tesla account type:**

1. **_[Tesla Business Fleet users](https://www.tesla.com/fleet):_** the Owner API is [being shut down](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api#2024-03-26-shutting-down-legacy-vehicle-api-endpoints). Fleet vehicles are upgraded gradually and an error message means that they must now use the official API.

2. **_Individual users:_** the Owner API is currently still accessible.

**Resume: if you are a Tesla Business Fleet user, you should migrate to the official API ASAP!** The official Tesla API will only become mandatory when the Owner API shuts down for all users. Until then you can and should continue to use the Owner API, as it is more feature-rich and has higher resolution streaming.

### Impacts/Limitations of New Endpoints

#### Tesla Fleet API: very limited recording resolution

The [Fleet API](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api) is similar to the Owner API but more comprehensive. However, retrieving vehicle information (`vehicle_data`) or sending commands is limited. The limits on the Owner API were historically much higher. It is likely that [these limits](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api#membership-levels) will also be applied soon to the API Owner.

#### Tesla Fleet Telemetry: non compatible by default

The [Tesla Fleet Telemetry](https://github.com/teslamotors/fleet-telemetry) differs from the "Owner" streaming. By default, metrics are sent to message queues instead of a websocket as streaming did. Historical streaming could send events every second, whereas Fleet Telemetry will only send information every minute at the minimum.

#### How to Use Tesla APIs

The setup to use the official Tesla APIs ([described below](#tesla-fleet-api)) is complex.
You can use a [third-party providers](#guide-for-third-party-providers) to easily access these APIs.

## Guide for Third-Party Providers

Environment variables allow changing the API and streaming endpoints.
You must use the `URL` and the `TOKEN` given by the third party API provider.

### [MyTeslaMate](https://www.myteslamate.com) (free)

#### MyTeslaMate Fleet API

1. Log in the [MyTeslaMate](https://app.myteslamate.com) website **with your Tesla account** and go to the [MyTeslaMate Fleet](https://app.myteslamate.com/fleet) page to get your `TOKEN`.
1. Add the following environment variables (using your `TOKEN` instead of _`xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx`_):

```yml
# API Fleet
- TOKEN=?token=xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx
- TESLA_API_HOST=https://api.myteslamate.com
- TESLA_AUTH_HOST=https://api.myteslamate.com
- TESLA_AUTH_PATH=/api/oauth2/v3
```

#### MyTeslaMate Streaming

MyTeslaMate also provides streaming by [reproducing the old streaming from the data sent by Fleet Telemetry](https://github.com/MyTeslaMate/websocket).

1. You need to "_Pair your vehicle(s)_" on the [fleet](https://app.myteslamate.com/fleet) page
1. Use the following dedicated environment variables:

   ```yml
   - TESLA_WSS_HOST=wss://streaming.myteslamate.com
   - TESLA_WSS_TLS_ACCEPT_INVALID_CERTS=true
   - TESLA_WSS_USE_VIN=true
   ```

1. Restart your instance

### [Teslemetry](https://teslemetry.com/pricing) (paid)

#### Teslemetry Fleet API

**_Important: Teslemetry's vehicle data polling is [pay-per-use](https://teslemetry.com/blog/road-away-from-polling)._**

1. Log in the [Teslemetry website](https://teslemetry.com) and create your `TOKEN`.
1. Use this `TOKEN` instead of _`xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx`_ and add the following environment variables:

   ```yml
   - TOKEN=?token=xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx
   - TESLA_API_HOST=https://api.teslemetry.com
   - TESLA_AUTH_HOST=https://api.teslemetry.com
   - TESLA_AUTH_PATH=/api/oauth2/v3
   ```

1. Restart your instance

#### Teslemetry Streaming

**_Important: Teslemetry's streaming is incompatible with Teslamate, you MUST disable manually the streaming in Teslamate settings._**

## Guide to using the official Tesla API directly (free)

### Requirements

- Advanced IT skills
- A dedicated public hosting
- A [free Tesla Fleet API plan](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api#membership-levels)

### Tesla Fleet API

1. Set up a third-party account at [developer.tesla.com](https://developer.tesla.com) as described on the [Tesla docs](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api#setup)
1. Add the following environment variable with your own domain :

   1. Use [the correct region](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api#endpoints-and-regional-requirements) in the `TESLA_API_HOST` field:
      - North America, Asia-Pacific (excluding China): [https://fleet-api.prd.na.vn.cloud.tesla.com](https://fleet-api.prd.na.vn.cloud.tesla.com)
      - Europe, Middle East, Africa: [https://fleet-api.prd.eu.vn.cloud.tesla.com](https://fleet-api.prd.eu.vn.cloud.tesla.com)
      - China: [https://fleet-api.prd.cn.vn.cloud.tesla.cn](https://fleet-api.prd.cn.vn.cloud.tesla.cn)
   1. Update the `TESLA_AUTH_CLIENT_ID` with the client ID of your Tesla application.

   ```yml
   # API Fleet
   - TESLA_API_HOST=https://fleet-api.prd.eu.vn.cloud.tesla.com
   - TESLA_AUTH_HOST=https://auth.tesla.com
   - TESLA_AUTH_PATH=/oauth2/v3
   - TESLA_AUTH_CLIENT_ID=xxxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```

1. (Optional) If you want to send commands or use Tesla Telemetry:
   1. Send drivers a "Pairing request" to be able to use your own [Tesla Vehicle Command Protocol http proxy to send commands](https://github.com/teslamotors/vehicle-command?tab=readme-ov-file#using-the-http-proxy)
   2. Send test commands or setup Telemetry to [stream it to your Teslamate](#streaming-via-tesla-telemetry)

#### Switching from Owners API to Fleet API

1. Sign out from the current Owners API by visiting the teslamate settings page
2. Follow step 1&2 from [Tesla Fleet API](https://docs.teslamate.org/docs/guides/api#tesla-fleet-api)
3. Restart your docker instance to make the change in effect
4. With proper setup, your teslamate instance will sign in automatically with your client ID after restart

### Streaming via Tesla Telemetry

**_Important: if you don't setup your own streaming, you MUST disable manually the streaming in Teslamate settings._**

To setup your own streaming server, you can follow these steps:

1. Setup a [Tesla Fleet Telemetry](https://github.com/teslamotors/fleet-telemetry) instance on a public domain (eg: _telemetry.mydomain.com_)
1. Add a [Google pubsub dispatcher](https://github.com/teslamotors/fleet-telemetry?tab=readme-ov-file#backendsdispatchers) to your own GCP PubSub.
1. Setup a [MyTeslaMate Streaming Server from Fleet Telemetry Events](https://github.com/MyTeslaMate/websocket) on a public domain (eg: _streaming.mydomain.com_)
1. Manually create a subscription to the `telemetry_V` created in PubSub by the Tesla Telemetry with:
   - Delivery type: Push
   - Endpoint URL: [https://streaming.mydomain.com](https://streaming.mydomain.com)
1. Update your environment variables:

   ```yml
   - TESLA_WSS_HOST=wss://streaming.mydomain.com
   - TESLA_WSS_TLS_ACCEPT_INVALID_CERTS=true
   - TESLA_WSS_USE_VIN=true
   ```

1. Restart your instance
